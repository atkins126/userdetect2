----

* Develop more plugins
	- workstation/server (NetServerGetInfo)
	- Computer SID
	- Win version
	- pc name
	- lanman workgroup name
	- user name
* (future): also develop a commandline-only-tool that only returns errorlevels, and which does only check a single identification string (equal to testuser.exe, "UserDetect1")
* transfer all functionalities from testuser.exe
* (small detail): in CLI mode, you can see the mainform for a few milliseconds
* (future): Full Task Definition File Editor functionality
* (idea): pass arguments to the plugin, e.g. FileAge(Letter.doc):20=calc.exe
	problem: too many requires escape signs and/or forbidden signs, and too complex
* put geticon functions in ud2_obj.pas?
* (idea): can a plugin have multiple methodnames?
* offer possibility to re-load the Task Definition File (maybe even auto-detect if they were changed)
* offer possibility möglichkeit to re-load all plugins
* (idea): slow DLL files killable (via GUI)
* splash screen because of probably slow DLLs
