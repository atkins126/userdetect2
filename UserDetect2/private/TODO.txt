----

* Develop more plugins
	- workstation/server (NetServerGetInfo)
	- lanman workgroup name
* transfer all functionalities from testuser.exe
* (future): Full Task Definition File Editor functionality
* (idea): pass arguments to the plugin, e.g. FileAge(Letter.doc):20=calc.exe
	problem: too many requires escape signs and/or forbidden signs, and too complex
* (idea): make WM_NORMAL configurable via INI/parameters
* put geticon functions in ud2_obj.pas?
* (idea): can a plugin have multiple methodnames?
* offer possibility to reload the Task Definition File (maybe even auto-detect if they were changed)
* offer possibility to reload all plugins
* (idea): slow DLL files killable (via GUI)
* splash screen because of probably slow DLLs
* (idea) environment variable plugin case-insensitive variant?
         OR: make a case-insensitive modifier for identTerms? (e.g. ComputerName$CASEINSENSITIVE$:johnpc)
* (idea) command syntax: cmdline run task without spec ini
* (idea) status for "not available (0 elements)" ?
* guid column is not sorted correctly!
* (idea) command syntax: <ini> /T <job> /noexec  --> returns only ExitCode, but does not run the application of the INI
* what does the environment string =::=::\ mean?!
* Possibility to load a different TDF after the program has already started.
* Argument for forcing to select a TDF.
* should the program really ask for a TDF when starting? why can't it run without TDF (in case the user only want to view the ident strings)
* Improve compatibility for older OS (e.g. Win95)
* Give .udp a file-type (icon)?
